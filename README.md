# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON TWEEETS USING WEB SCRAPING

In this project I have performed sentiment analysis on tweets using web scraping. 

You will find explanation of each and every step performed.
It flows a streamlined steps that must to followed while performing NLP tasks and building Machine Learning projects.

LIBRARIES USED -> snscrape, numpy, pandas, nltk, neattext

snscrape : for web scraping
numpy and pandas : for data manipulation
nltk : for performing NLP operations
neattext : for pre-processing

(I personally find it very convenient and easy to make use of neattext for all the pre-processing task as it is simple to perform, code and understand.)

Although the model is not much dynamic but it performs the task well, very soon I will be updating the code file to make it more flexible.
